The luminous blue variable (LBV) in the core did not show much S Dor activity, i.e. it was in a relatively quiescent stage. This situation was very favourable for studying its optical micro variations. It appears that the central LBV pulsates (presumably in a non-radial mode) like other massive evolved stars, the {alpha} Cyg variables. The quasi-period is 58.56d. The linear ephemeris is: JD_max_=2448875.0 +58.56 E. Support was found for the existence of the presumed periodicity of 52.4d of the so-called \"dimples\", shallow dips in the light curve which only last for a few days. The cause may be the eclipse of a small companion or of a hot spot in an accretion disk. The H{beta} index became bluer by ~0.07mag during the last 11/2 years and shows an oscillation in anti-phase with the 58.56d pulsation, suggesting that the HII region(s) responsible for the hydrogen line emission has a relatively high luminosity. This is another reason to suppose that a second luminous source, perhaps a luminous disk (with a hot spot), may be present in the {eta} Car system.

To remove the FeII contribution in these objects, an accurate template is necessary. We used very high signal-to-noise, medium resolution archive optical spectra of I Zw 1 to build such a template. I Zw 1 is a bright narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. As such it is well suited for a detailed analysis of its emission line spectrum. Furthermore it is known to have a very peculiar spectrum with, in addition to the usual broad and narrow line regions, two emission regions emitting broad and blue shifted [OIII] lines making it a peculiarly interesting object. While analysing the spectra, we found that the narrow-line region is, unlike the NLR of most Seyfert 1 galaxies, a very low excitation region dominated by both permitted and forbidden FeII lines. It is very similar to the emission spectrum of a blob in {eta} Carinae which is a low temperature (T~6500K), relatively high density (N_e_=10^6^cm^-3) cloud. The FeII lines in this cloud are mainly due to pumping via the stellar continuum radiation field (Verner et al., 2002ApJ...581.1154V). We did not succeed in modelling the spectrum of the broad-line region, and we suggest that a non radiative heating mechanism increases the temperature in the excited HI region, thus providing the necessary additional excitation of the FeII lines. For the low-excitation narrow-line region, we are able to settle boundaries to the physical conditions accounting for the forbidden and permitted FeII lines (10^6^<N_e_<10^7^cm^-3^; 10^-6^<U<10^-5^).', 'content_level': 'research', 'waveband': '', 'created': '2004-03-29T00:00:00', 'updated': '2023-02-02T00:00:00', 'access_urls': 'http://tapvizier.cds.unistra.fr/TAPVizieR/tap:::py VO sep:::http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-2?-source=J/A+A/417/515:::py VO sep:::http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/votable?-source=J/A+A/417/515:::py VO sep:::https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/assocdata/?obs_collection=J/A+A/417/515'}, {'res_title': 'Emission lines of Sr filament near {eta} Car', 'res_description': 'We have obtained deep spectra from 1640 to 10100{AA} with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the strontium filament, a largely neutral emission nebulosity lying close to the very luminous star Eta Carinae and showing an uncommon spectrum.

These so-called spectroscopic events are most likely caused by the close approach of a companion. We compare the recent spectroscopic event in mid-2014 to the events in 2003 and 2009 and investigate long-term trends. Eta Car was observed with HST STIS, VLT UVES, and CTIO 1.5m CHIRON for a period of more than two years in 2012-2015. Archival observations with these instruments cover three orbital cycles and the events of 2003.5, 2009.1, and 2014.6. The STIS spectra provide high spatial resolution and include epochs during the 2014 event when observations from most ground-based observatories were not feasible. The strategy for UVES observations allows for a multidimensional analysis, because each location in the reflection nebula is correlated with a different stellar latitude. Important spectroscopic diagnostics during {eta} Car's events show significant changes in 2014 compared to previous events. While the timing of the first HeII {lambda}4686 flash was remarkably similar to previous events, the HeII equivalent widths were slightly larger, and the line flux increased by a factor of ~7 compared to 2003. The second HeII peak occurred at about the same phase as in 2009, but was stronger. The HeI line flux grew by a factor of ~8 in 2009-2014 compared to 1998-2003. The NII emission lines also increased in strength. On the other hand, H{alpha} and FeII lines show the smallest emission strengths ever observed in {eta} Car. The optical continuum brightened by a factor of ~4 in the past 10-15 years. The polar spectrum shows fewer changes in the broad wind emission lines: the FeII emission strength decreased by a factor of ~2 (compared to a factor of ~4 in our direct line of sight).

We show that gas giving rise to H{alpha} and HeI emission is dynamically well correlated with but not identical to gas seen through forbidden-line emission. Gas temperatures are derived from line-width ratios, and densities from [SII] doublet ratios. The spatial variation of N ionization is also studied, and found to differ between the approaching and receding components. The main result is that the bulk of the emission lines in the central part of Carina arise from several distinct shell-like expanding regions, the most evident found around {eta} Car, the Trumpler 14 core, and the star WR25. These \"shells\" are non-spherical and show distortions probably caused by collisions with other shells or colder, higher-density gas. Some of them are also partially obscured by foreground dust lanes, while very little dust is found in their interior. Preferential directions, parallel to the dark dust lanes, are found in the shell geometries and physical properties, probably related to strong density gradients in the studied region. We also find evidence that the ionizing flux emerging from {eta} Car and the surrounding Homunculus nebula varies with polar angle. The high-velocity components in the wings of H{alpha} are found to arise from expanding dust reflecting the {eta} Car spectrum.', 'content_level': 'research', 'waveband': '', 'created': '2016-06-17T08:03:55', 'updated': '2022-10-10T00:00:00', 'access_urls': 'http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-2?-source=J/A+A/591/A74:::py VO sep:::http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/votable?-source=J/A+A/591/A74:::py VO sep:::http://tapvizier.cds.unistra.fr/TAPVizieR/tap:::py VO sep:::http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/conesearch/J/A+A/591/A74/table1?'}]\n"

The luminous blue variable (LBV) in the core did not show much S Dor activity, i.e. it was in a relatively quiescent stage. This situation was very favourable for studying its optical micro variations. It appears that the central LBV pulsates (presumably in a non-radial mode) like other massive evolved stars, the {alpha} Cyg variables. The quasi-period is 58.56d. The linear ephemeris is: JD_max_=2448875.0 +58.56 E. Support was found for the existence of the presumed periodicity of 52.4d of the so-called \"dimples\", shallow dips in the light curve which only last for a few days. The cause may be the eclipse of a small companion or of a hot spot in an accretion disk. The H{beta} index became bluer by ~0.07mag during the last 11/2 years and shows an oscillation in anti-phase with the 58.56d pulsation, suggesting that the HII region(s) responsible for the hydrogen line emission has a relatively high luminosity. This is another reason to suppose that a second luminous source, perhaps a luminous disk (with a hot spot), may be present in the {eta} Car system.

To remove the FeII contribution in these objects, an accurate template is necessary. We used very high signal-to-noise, medium resolution archive optical spectra of I Zw 1 to build such a template. I Zw 1 is a bright narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. As such it is well suited for a detailed analysis of its emission line spectrum. Furthermore it is known to have a very peculiar spectrum with, in addition to the usual broad and narrow line regions, two emission regions emitting broad and blue shifted [OIII] lines making it a peculiarly interesting object. While analysing the spectra, we found that the narrow-line region is, unlike the NLR of most Seyfert 1 galaxies, a very low excitation region dominated by both permitted and forbidden FeII lines. It is very similar to the emission spectrum of a blob in {eta} Carinae which is a low temperature (T~6500K), relatively high density (N_e_=10^6^cm^-3) cloud. The FeII lines in this cloud are mainly due to pumping via the stellar continuum radiation field (Verner et al., 2002ApJ...581.1154V). We did not succeed in modelling the spectrum of the broad-line region, and we suggest that a non radiative heating mechanism increases the temperature in the excited HI region, thus providing the necessary additional excitation of the FeII lines. For the low-excitation narrow-line region, we are able to settle boundaries to the physical conditions accounting for the forbidden and permitted FeII lines (10^6^<N_e_<10^7^cm^-3^; 10^-6^<U<10^-5^).', 'content_level': 'research', 'waveband': '', 'created': '2004-03-29T00:00:00', 'updated': '2023-02-02T00:00:00', 'access_urls': 'http://tapvizier.cds.unistra.fr/TAPVizieR/tap:::py VO sep:::http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-2?-source=J/A+A/417/515:::py VO sep:::http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/votable?-source=J/A+A/417/515:::py VO sep:::https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/assocdata/?obs_collection=J/A+A/417/515'}, {'res_title': 'Emission lines of Sr filament near {eta} Car', 'res_description': 'We have obtained deep spectra from 1640 to 10100{AA} with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the strontium filament, a largely neutral emission nebulosity lying close to the very luminous star Eta Carinae and showing an uncommon spectrum.

These so-called spectroscopic events are most likely caused by the close approach of a companion. We compare the recent spectroscopic event in mid-2014 to the events in 2003 and 2009 and investigate long-term trends. Eta Car was observed with HST STIS, VLT UVES, and CTIO 1.5m CHIRON for a period of more than two years in 2012-2015. Archival observations with these instruments cover three orbital cycles and the events of 2003.5, 2009.1, and 2014.6. The STIS spectra provide high spatial resolution and include epochs during the 2014 event when observations from most ground-based observatories were not feasible. The strategy for UVES observations allows for a multidimensional analysis, because each location in the reflection nebula is correlated with a different stellar latitude. Important spectroscopic diagnostics during {eta} Car's events show significant changes in 2014 compared to previous events. While the timing of the first HeII {lambda}4686 flash was remarkably similar to previous events, the HeII equivalent widths were slightly larger, and the line flux increased by a factor of ~7 compared to 2003. The second HeII peak occurred at about the same phase as in 2009, but was stronger. The HeI line flux grew by a factor of ~8 in 2009-2014 compared to 1998-2003.
